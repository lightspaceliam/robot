# Robot Code Challenge

# Installation 

- Download or clone the code base to your local workstation: 
```
git clone https://github.com/lightspaceliam/robo.git
```
- Navigate into the directory created by the clone command
- Install node modules: 
```
npm install
```
- Run the project: 
```
npm run
```
- This should open in your default browser and launch the React web application. If not, open your browser of choice and use the default url: http://localhost:3000/

# Summary

As this coding challenge is designed to see how results are delivered with the language/s relevant to the position, I have chosen to construct this application with:

- React 
- Redux
- TypeScript
- Material UI 

# Deviation from Requirements

- I have made the assumption that this test was not originally designed for a front-end technology stack such as React. I have deviated from the requirements of providing a textbox for user input, instead choosing to provide a control pad for moving the robot and reporting its current location.
- Currently I have written minor Unit Tests with Jest. Integration tests still to come
